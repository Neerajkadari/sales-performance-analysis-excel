📊 Sales Performance Analysis (Excel)
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing sales performance using Excel, starting from raw transactional data and converting it into meaningful business insights. The goal is to evaluate revenue, order volume, growth trends, and performance across regions, products, and sales representatives, similar to a real-world business analytics task.

🧩 Business Problem

Businesses need clear visibility into:

How much revenue is being generated

Which regions, categories, and sales reps drive performance

Whether growth is driven by high order volume or high-value orders

This project answers these questions using structured Excel analysis.

📂 Dataset Overview

Dataset: Global Superstore sales data

Data type: Order-level transactional data

Time period: Multi-year historical data

Key fields used:

Order Date

Product

Category

Region / Market

Sales

Profit

Sales Representative

📈 KPIs Analyzed

Total Revenue – Total sales generated

Total Orders – Number of orders received

Average Order Value (AOV) – Revenue per order

Sales Growth % – Period-over-period growth

Contribution by Region – Revenue share by region/market

Contribution by Category – Revenue share by product category

Sales Rep Efficiency – Revenue and order contribution by sales reps

🛠️ Tools & Skills Used

Microsoft Excel

Data Cleaning & Preparation

Master Tables (Product, Region, Sales Rep)

XLOOKUP (primary lookup method)

VLOOKUP & INDEX + MATCH (practice & legacy understanding)

SUMIFS & COUNTIFS for KPI calculations

Pivot Tables for summary analysis

Conditional Formatting for business insights

Dashboards & KPI cards

Data Validation for controlled inputs

Macros for basic automation (refresh & reset dashboard)

🔍 Analysis Performed

Cleaned raw sales data and handled invalid records

Built master tables to standardize dimensions

Calculated revenue-based and order-based KPIs

Analyzed sales contribution by region, category, and sales rep

Compared volume-driven vs value-driven performance

Created dashboards for management-level reporting

💡 Key Business Insights

Some markets generate high revenue with fewer orders, indicating higher AOV

Certain regions rely on high order volume with lower average order value

Sales performance varies significantly across regions and product categories

⚠️ Challenges Faced

Confusion between Region and Market dimensions

SUMIFS returning zero due to incorrect grouping fields

Exact text matching issues during lookups

Understanding the difference between revenue-based and order-based KPIs

🚀 Automation

Created a macro to refresh all data connections and pivot tables

Added a dashboard button to reset filters and refresh data in one click

🔮 Limitations & Next Steps

Analysis is limited to historical sales data

SQL-based analysis can be added for larger datasets

Further automation and scheduled refresh can be implemented
